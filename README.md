# Measurement Automation of Microscope Stage Stability and Reproducibility
## Introduction
The [QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/) stage stability and reproducibility.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
Visit the <a href="/StageRepeatability/"> list</a> (scripts, documentation and videos) of stage repeatability assessment examples that can be adapted to a series of microscope stage and software options. 

## Work in Progress
To improve reproducibility in light microscopy, QUAREP LiMi WG6 aims to support as many microscope systems as possible. You are kindly invited to participate in this process by sharing your automation solution.
